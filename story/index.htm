<p class="mt3 mb0 bold uppercase">The Engagement</p>

<p class="light">We had a small group of friends and family out to celebrate my birthday. Toward the end of dinner, I opened gifts and ended with Mike’s. He had given me little gifts throughout the week already, so I was just expecting some other small things. I opened a box and pulled out Angie’s childhood stuffed toy cat. It was cute, but I was totally confused about it. ‘Just read the card.’ Mike said.</p>

<p class="mxn4"><img src="../card.jpg" alt="" class="fit"></p>

<p class="light">“Mi-Sa, This kitten is obviously not real. That will only be temporary. When you come back from Albuquerque, we will find you the real kitten that will make you happy. Happy Birthday.”</p>

<p class="light">I had been bugging Mike big time for a few years now about wanting to get a cat. Me and a few other cat lovers at the table started blabbing about the kitty hype until Mike cleared his throat and said, ‘Uh...there’s more to read.’</p>

<p class="light">I read the rest. ‘What?!’ I had to read it again.</p>

<p class="light">“Mi-Sa, You make me the happiest man I could possibly imagine being. Your smiling face alone can remind me why I’m even alive. I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with someone as bright and beautiful as you are. I hope that I can provide you with all that you deserve. I want to grow old and crazy with you. Will you marry me?</p>
<p class="light">-Love, Michael”</p>

<p class="mt3 mb2 bold uppercase">How we met</p>
<p class="mt0 mb1 uppercase h4 dark-purple">HIS STORY</p>
<p class="light mt0">Nearly 11 years ago I met Mi-Sa. After the normal pleasantries, the next thing out of my mouth, was “Nice Batman shirt. ” Somehow that led to 10 wonderful years with her.</p>
<p class="light">I was immediately infatuated with her. She was interesting, smart, and had an amazingly eclectic taste in music. Not to mention beautiful. She was however, taken.</p>
<p class="light">The next few weeks, months? We spent somewhat casually meeting at parties or at shows. I say casually because I don't want her to know I was doing my best to make an effort to be where she was. We had fun. I enjoyed every moment I was allowed to spend with her.</p>
<p class="light">Then came the fashion show. Texas Tech was holding a fashion show for the Fashion Design seniors. We happened to be in the same place when she mentioned that one of her models was going to be a no-show. I don’t remember who brought up the question if I would be a model, but I could not turn that down.</p>   
<p class="light">After the show we had a heart to heart. I saw a side of her that I hadn’t before, vulnerable, caring, someone who needed what I did. Love and stability.</p>
<p class="light">She left for New York on an internship soon after. We kept in touch through myspace, sending messages and leaving corny status updates in Spanish to each other.</p>
<p class="light">She returned to Texas on my birthday. I left the birthday party thrown in my honor to go meet her at a friend’s house. She was more beautiful than I had remembered. We started dating just about a month after that.</p>
<p class="light">On an outing together I said to her “I’m not going anywhere.” I meant it then and I mean it now. I can only hope these ten years are only a fraction of what’s to come.</p>
<p class="light">Mi-Sa, I love you immensely. I wouldn’t change a thing. You are the world to me.
</p>

<p class="mt4 mb1 uppercase h4 dark-purple">HER STORY</p>
<p class="light mt0">I met the love of my life at a friend's house nearly 11 years ago. My friend, Fatty, was wanting to start a live band and had recruited me as a keyboardist, building on top of the rap group that he, Mike, Duffy, and D-Low had started in high school.</p>
<p class="light mt0">So I show up for the first practice and the only free seat was next to Mike. Being shy and awkward, I sat down and naturally ignored his existence until he held his hand out and said, 'Hi, I'm Mike. Nice Batman shirt.'
<p class="light mt0">We had gone to the same high school and ran around the same group of friends, but somehow had never run into each other until then. He was very nice but few words were exchanged. I was also dating someone else at the time. It allowed us to slowly become friends and get to know each other. I found out he was close to his awesome family, and we had a lot in common. I liked his sense of style, we both had the same taste in music, and were both artistic. He was hella good-looking and intelligent and I loved seeing his smile and big, blue eyes. We'd hang out at practice, parties and concerts and would end up laughing our heads off.</p>
<p class="light mt0">What really set things in motion for us was my Senior Fashion Show at Texas Tech about a year and a half later. One of my models fell out so I asked Mike to fill in. Really though, I saw it as a chance for us to hopefully get closer. Throughout the week, girls (and guys!) would come up to me to ask who my tall, blonde model was. It got to a point where I just started telling them 'Back off, I'm working on making him mine!'</p>
<p class="light mt0">After the show, we celebrated with a small group of friends. Everyone was partying but Mike and I ended up in the kitchen by ourselves in deep discussion and finally let each other know all the feelings we had bottled up inside all this time.</p>
<p class="light mt0">Soon after, I had to leave for an internship in New York for the summer. We kept in touch any way we could; Hand-drawn letters, Myspace, phone calls and AIM.</p>
<p class="light mt0">The day I came back happened to be on his birthday and we met at Fatty's, the same place we met years ago. Only this time we knew we had something special. He had even left his own birthday party to see me. I remember him holding my hand for the first time. It felt electric and made my hand jump. It all was too good to be true, and any time my unsolicited insecurities kicked in, he would tell me he wasn't going anywhere. I'm blessed to still have him by my side. He shows me every day in little and big ways how he cares.</p>
<p class="light mt0">Michael, you are who I love the most, and who I laugh with the most. You are my best friend, and I'm excited to spend forever with you. I love you. You're my homie for life.</p>
