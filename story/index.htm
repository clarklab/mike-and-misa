<p class="mt3 mb0 bold uppercase">How we got engaged</p>

<p class="light">We had a small group of friends and family out to celebrate my birthday. Toward the end of dinner, I opened gifts and ended with Mike’s. He had given me little gifts throughout the week already, so I was just expecting some other small things. I opened a box and pulled out Angie’s childhood stuffed toy cat. It was cute, but I was totally confused about it. ‘Just read the card.’ Mike said.</p>

<p class="mxn4"><img src="../card.jpg" alt="" class="fit"></p>

<p class="light">“Mi-Sa, This kitten is obviously not real. That will only be temporary. When you come back from Albuquerque, we will find you the real kitten that will make you happy. Happy Birthday.”</p>

<p class="light">I had been bugging Mike big time for a few years now about wanting to get a cat. Me and a few other cat lovers at the table started blabbing about the kitty hype until Mike cleared his throat and said, ‘Uh...there’s more to read.’</p>

<p class="light">I read the rest. ‘What?!’ I had to read it again.</p>

<p class="light">“Mi-Sa, You make me the happiest man I could possibly imagine being. Your smiling face alone can remind me why I’m even alive. I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with someone as bright and beautiful as you are. I hope that I can provide you with all that you deserve. I want to grow old and crazy with you. Will you marry me?</p>
<p class="light">-Love, Michael”</p>
